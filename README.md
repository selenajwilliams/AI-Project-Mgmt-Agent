# AI-Project-Mgmt-Agent

Throughout this project, I made extensive use of AI to gain hands-on experience with AI development software that is changing the industry. 

I used AI in these ways throughout the project:

* ChatGPT to improve project structure, debug, develop dummy data, and go from function comments & definitions to working code
* Vercel to develop a task manager

Learnings:

* I learned that AI can drastically change the dev process from what I'm used to, closing the gap for novice programmers to be able to deliver high quality code through prompt-based instruction
* High quality code, UI, and full-stack projects are becoming commodified with AI and people and companies who don't capitalize on these cost savings will miss out -- although there are benefits to human-driven development
* I learned that I personally prefer developing with minimal use of AI for debugging rather than AI-driven development (e.g. through prompts), but that time and place to use AI is context dependent
* This also affirmed my passion for fronteir AI and developing AI itself :)
